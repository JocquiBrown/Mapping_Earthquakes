# Mapping_Earthquakes
- The purpose of this project is to perform an additional analysis on earthquake data. Specifically, we will be analyzing earhtquake data for all quakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 and comparing them to the location of the tectonic plates on the earth. Aa additional map for data visualization will also be generated.
